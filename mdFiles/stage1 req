Stage 1:  Proposal & Analysis:
Your team will submit a proposal that describe in detailthe specific database system you plan to create.  
Your proposal should include the following:

1A. Problem Descriptionand Solution
State the problem that your software will solve and briefly describe your proposed solution.

1B. Functionality and Criteria of Success
Describe the application that is planned to be created.  Clearly state the objectives / goalsby listing all functionalities and output of your final product.  For example, the functionalities for a bank’s client transaction software may be:
•store personal client info•store history of account transactions•store current balance
•search for client information
•sort client information
•calculate number of NSF checks
•calculate average balance
•display client info
•report clients with balances over x amount of dollars

1C. Solution Mastery Aspects
You must choose a project that makes use of the all the programming conceptsand complexity requirements listed above.  
For each of the programming concepts, indicate where your proposed system would make use of that concept.
Describe how the structure of your software will satisfy the complexity requirements(the different class hierarchies and how theyare connected)
